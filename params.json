The first part retrieves real weather data into several JSON files and\r\nthe second part creates two different visualizations from the retrieved data.\r\n\r\n##Screenshot\r\nThis was our inital concept and visualization of what we wanted to mimic:\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\t<img src=\"https://github.com/oplS16projects/Racket-Weather/blob/master/Example.png\">\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThis is example output of our final program:\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n\t<img src=\"https://github.com/oplS16projects/Racket-Weather/blob/master/Program_Output.PNG\">\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n##Concepts Demonstrated\r\n* **File I/O** was used to store the weather data in JSON format. It is also used in both JT and Huy's viz programs.\r\n* **Recursion** was used to grab the min and max of values from the JSON file\r\n\r\n##External Technology and Libraries\r\nRacket Libraries that we used include the following:\r\n\r\n1. [net/url](https://docs.racket-lang.org/net/url.html)\r\n2. [json](https://docs.racket-lang.org/json/)\r\n3. [plot](https://docs.racket-lang.org/plot/)\r\n4. [2htdp/batch-io](https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpbatch-io.html)\r\n5. [2htdp/image](https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpimage.html)\r\n\r\nWe also used one external API, [the OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api),\r\nto retrieve real weather data for several US cities.\r\n\r\n##Favorite Scheme Expressions\r\n####Jason Downing\r\nWeather Expression\r\n```\r\n;; Stuff\r\n```\r\n####Huy Huynh\r\nMagic Viz Expression\r\n```\r\n;; PUT CODE HERE\r\n```\r\n\r\n###JT Shepple\r\nMagic Viz Expression\r\n```\r\n;; PUT CODE HERE\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Additional Remarks\r\nThis project is cool.\r\n\r\n#How to Download and Run\r\nDownload the zip, or git clone the repository from the following link:\r\n[Racket Weather](https://github.com/oplS16projects/Racket-Weather)\r\n\r\nTo run, open \"racket_weather.rkt\" in DrRacket. It can be found the in the \"Source\"\r\nsub directory of the Git Repository. Once the file is open, click \"Run\" and the\r\nfile will run \"get_weather.rkt\", \"JT_viz.rkt\", and \"Huy_viz.rkt\" files. The REPL\r\nwill show the Visualations that are created based on the JSON data found in the\r\nJSON sub directory of the Source directory.\r\n",
